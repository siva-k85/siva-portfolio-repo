## Why ATS Optimization Matters

75% of resumes never reach human eyes. They're filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) — software that scans, parses, and ranks resumes before recruiters see them.

## The ATS Parsing Process

### How ATS Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Converts your resume to plain text
2. **Parsing**: Identifies sections (experience, education, skills)
3. **Keyword Matching**: Compares against job description
4. **Scoring**: Ranks based on match percentage
5. **Filtering**: Only top scores proceed to humans

## ATS-Friendly Format Guidelines

### File Format

✅ **DO USE:**
- .docx (best compatibility)
- .pdf (if text-selectable, not scanned)
- Simple .txt as fallback

❌ **AVOID:**
- Images, graphics, or charts
- Scanned documents
- Unusual formats (.pages, .odt)

### Structure

```
[NAME]
[CONTACT INFO]

PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
[2-3 lines]

EXPERIENCE
[Company] | [Title] | [Dates]
• Achievement with metrics
• Action verb + context + result

EDUCATION
[Degree] | [School] | [Year]

SKILLS
[Skill category]: skill1, skill2, skill3
```

## Keyword Optimization Strategy

### 1. Mirror Job Description Language

**Job Says**: "Experience with Python for data analysis"
**Resume Says**: "Developed Python scripts for data analysis" ✅
**Not**: "Coded in various languages for analytics" ❌

### 2. Include Variations

- Acronyms AND full names: "AI (Artificial Intelligence)"
- Different tenses: manage, managed, managing
- Synonyms: ML, Machine Learning, machine-learning

### 3. Strategic Keyword Placement

1. **Professional Summary** (highest weight)
2. **Skills Section** (explicit matches)
3. **Experience Bullets** (context matters)
4. **Education/Certifications** (credibility)

## Common ATS Pitfalls to Avoid

### Formatting Mistakes

❌ **Headers/Footers**: Contact info gets lost
❌ **Tables**: Scrambles reading order
❌ **Columns**: Creates parsing chaos
❌ **Special Characters**: • is fine, but avoid ◆, ➤
❌ **Fancy Fonts**: Stick to Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman

### Content Errors

❌ **Keyword Stuffing**: Obvious and penalized
❌ **White Text Tricks**: Modern ATS detects this
❌ **Irrelevant Skills**: Dilutes match score
❌ **Missing Dates**: Creates parsing errors

## ATS Testing Tools

### Free Options

1. **Jobscan**: Upload resume + job description
2. **Resume Worded**: AI-powered ATS scan
3. **VMock**: Detailed parsing report

### DIY Test

1. Save resume as plain .txt
2. Open in Notepad
3. Check if readable and organized
4. If it looks scrambled, ATS will struggle
