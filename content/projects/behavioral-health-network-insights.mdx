## Navigating Behavioral Health Access Barriers

### Initial Assessment

Waitlists exceeded 90 days for psychiatry and 60 days for adolescent therapy. No consolidated view existed across community partners, internal clinics, and telehealth providers.

### Data Strategy

- Combined referral queues, clinician availability, payer mix, and no-show history from 14 disparate systems
- Modeled patient acuity and social determinants using synthetic census attributes
- Applied queueing models to simulate throughput under multiple staffing and telehealth expansion scenarios

### Insight Delivery

- Built Power BI command center with filters by diagnosis, payer class, and region
- Introduced weekly executive packet summarizing bottlenecks and provider utilization
- Layered scenario planning module to test extended hours, respite care partnerships, and telepsychiatry scaling

### Impact

- **41% reduction** in psychiatry waitlists within 12 weeks
- **2.3x increase** in telehealth utilization for rural regions
- Secured $3.1M in state grant funding by demonstrating throughput improvements
- Standardized referral triage criteria, cutting inappropriate referrals by 24%

### Human Factors

- Facilitated 6 design sprints with social workers, psychiatrists, and patient advocates
- Co-created culturally competent intake scripts to improve follow-through

### Roadmap

- Integrating behavioral health EHR data interoperability metrics
- Standing up predictive retention models to stabilize workforce planning
