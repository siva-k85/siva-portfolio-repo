## Building a Clinical Decision Support System for Readmission Risk

### Background

Hospital readmissions within 30 days cost Medicare $26 billion annually. Early identification of high-risk patients enables targeted interventions.

### Methodology

#### Data Sources
- **EHR Data**: 50,000 patient records from 2019-2023
- **Features**: Demographics, diagnoses, medications, vitals, lab results, social determinants
- **Target**: 30-day unplanned readmission (binary)

#### Model Development

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Comorbidity indices (Charlson, Elixhauser)
   - Medication complexity scores
   - Social vulnerability index
   - Previous admission patterns

2. **Model Selection**
   - Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
   - Winner: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with 87% AUC

3. **Interpretability**
   - SHAP values for feature importance
   - Individual risk factor decomposition
   - Clinician-friendly explanations

### Implementation

#### Dashboard Features
- **Risk Score**: 0-100 scale with confidence intervals
- **Key Drivers**: Top 5 factors contributing to risk
- **Interventions**: Evidence-based recommendations
- **Trends**: Risk trajectory over admission

#### Integration
- RESTful API for EHR integration
- Real-time scoring at admission and discharge
- Daily batch processing for inpatients

### Results

- **Accuracy**: 87% AUC, 82% sensitivity at 70% specificity
- **Impact**: 18% reduction in readmissions for high-risk cohort
- **ROI**: $1.2M saved in penalties first year
- **Adoption**: Used by 85% of discharge planners
