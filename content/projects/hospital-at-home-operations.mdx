## Accelerating Care-at-Home Capacity

### Context

The system launched a hospital-at-home program across three counties but struggled to scale beyond 28 concurrent patients. Constraints included nurse travel time, remote monitoring device inventory, and partner pharmacy delivery windows.

### Solution Blueprint

#### Integrated Data Fabric
- Consolidated referral streams, ADT events, staffing rosters, and durable medical equipment inventory
- Captured patient acuity scores and home risk factors to drive prioritization

#### Optimization Engine
- Formulated mixed-integer program in Gurobi to assign nurses, paramedics, and therapists by skill, shift, and travel radius
- Embedded contingency buffers for weather, higher-risk comorbidities, and rehospitalization risk
- Automated inventory allocation forecasting for vital patch kits and IV pumps

#### Command Center Tools
- Delivered React-based control tower with live census map, clinician routing, and supply chain alerts
- Integrated Supabase real-time channels for status updates from field teams
- Created experiment framework to A/B test visit cadence and remote monitoring escalation thresholds

### Measured Results

- **3x census growth** (28 â†’ 84 patients) within 5 months without additional inpatient admissions
- **31% reduction** in average nurse drive time per visit
- **98% patient satisfaction** sustained per HCAHPS home survey
- Achieved CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home compliance with automated documentation pipeline

### Future Roadmap

- Add predictive readmission risk layering to discharge planning
- Expand to palliative care and post-surgical cohorts
