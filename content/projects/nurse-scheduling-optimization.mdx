## Case Study: Optimizing Nurse Scheduling at Scale

### Challenge

A 500-bed hospital network struggled with nurse scheduling inefficiencies:
- Manual scheduling taking 20+ hours per week
- High overtime costs ($2M annually)
- Staff dissatisfaction due to unfair shift distribution
- Compliance issues with union agreements

### Solution

#### 1. Predictive Demand Modeling
Developed ML models to forecast patient census by unit:
- Historical admission patterns
- Seasonal trends and holidays
- Local event calendars
- Weather impact analysis

#### 2. Optimization Engine
Built mixed-integer programming model with Gurobi:
- **Objective**: Minimize cost while maximizing staff preferences
- **Constraints**: 
  - Skill mix requirements
  - Union rules (max consecutive days, rest periods)
  - Individual preferences and availability
  - Fair distribution of weekends/holidays

#### 3. Implementation
- Python-based backend with SQL integration
- Web interface for schedule viewing and swaps
- Mobile app for real-time notifications

### Results

- **Staff Satisfaction**: +15% in survey scores
- **Cost Reduction**: 20% decrease in overtime expenses
- **Scheduling Time**: Reduced from 20 hours to 2 hours weekly
- **Compliance**: 100% adherence to union agreements

### Key Learnings

- Change management crucial for adoption
- Flexibility needed for last-minute adjustments
- Regular model retraining improves accuracy
