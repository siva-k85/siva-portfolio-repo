## Problem
Paper-based residency evaluations slowed learning loops and suffered from low completion.

## Approach
- Architected comprehensive platform integrating real-time feedback, encounter tracking, performance analytics.
- DistilBERT-based summarization to reduce faculty cognitive load.
- Firestore to BigQuery pipeline (less than 2s latency); React admin panel.

## Result
- **Compliance**: 19% â†’ **75%**
- **Assessment time**: -65%
- **Reliability**: 99.9% sync

## What I'd improve next
Role-aware analytics and feedback nudges.
