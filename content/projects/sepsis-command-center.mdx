## Coordinated Sepsis Response in Under One Minute

### Challenge

Four hospitals across the system missed CMS SEP-1 benchmarks for three consecutive quarters. Existing EHR alerts created alarm fatigue and lacked cross-unit visibility, causing interventions to be delayed beyond the Golden Hour.

### Architecture

1. **Signal Ingestion**
   - Streamed 120 physiologic signals per bed from bedside monitors via HL7
   - Captured hourly vitals, labs, and nursing notes through FHIR Subscriptions
   - Normalized feeds in Kafka with schema registry enforcement

2. **Risk Scoring Pipeline**
   - Developed ensemble model combining NEWS2, qSOFA, and gradient boosting with SHAP transparency
   - Maintained feature store in TimescaleDB with 5-second temporal resolution
   - Tuned for 92% sensitivity and 15-minute early warning horizon

3. **Command Center UX**
   - Built React dashboard with hospital-wide heat maps, unit-level cohorts, and clinician routing workflows
   - Embedded clinical checklists aligned to Surviving Sepsis Campaign protocols
   - Integrated Responder mobile app push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging

### Outcomes

- **14% reduction** in sepsis mortality during 6-month pilot across 4 hospitals
- **9.3-hour faster** bundle completion time compared to baseline
- **52% fewer** false-positive alerts through adaptive thresholding
- Automated CMS SEP-1 reporting, eliminating 40 analyst hours per month

### Sustainability

- Established command center staffing model with critical care nurses and quality analysts
- Published success metrics in AMIA Clinical Informatics Conference proceedings
- Built executive dashboard tracking ROI, bed capacity, and clinical throughput
