## Rebuilding Shared-Savings Strategy for ACO Partners

### Problem

The health system entered 5 new value-based care agreements without a robust understanding of downside risk. Their actuarial vendor delivered static reports that arrived six weeks late, preventing clinical teams from intervening on rising-risk populations.

### Approach

#### Data Foundation
- Ingested 3.2 TB of claims, EHR encounters, lab panels, and social determinant feeds into Snowflake
- Applied CMS-HCC v28 for prospective risk adjustment
- Modeled 1.1 million patient-months with condition hierarchy rollups

#### Risk Engine
- Built segmented gradient boosting models to forecast avoidable admissions and chronic condition exacerbations
- Layered propensity scoring to simulate payor benchmarks and shared savings targets
- Created contract-specific Monte Carlo scenarios to show best / base / worst financial outcomes

#### Operationalization
- Orchestrated incremental fact tables with Dagster and dbt
- Deployed Tableau scorecards with cohort drill-downs by practice, physician, and payor contract
- Triggered weekly outreach lists through Salesforce Care Management

### Outcomes

- **$6.7M** projected shared savings for contract year 1 (confirmed by payor actuarial true-up)
- **28% reduction** in avoidable admissions for top 5 risk segments
- **21-day faster** insight delivery versus previous vendor reports
- Clinicians adopted daily dashboards (82% weekly active users across 14 clinics)

### Lessons Learned

- Pair financial modeling with clinical insights; revenue teams alone could not drive action
- Versioned scenario planning ensured executives trusted model transparency

### Next Steps

- Integrate pharmacy rebates and remote patient monitoring feeds
- Extend risk explainability to patient-facing care navigation portal
